## 2.5 Decompostition And Abstraction

---
### How Do We Write Code?
---

- so far...
    - covered language mechanisms
    - know how to write different files for each computation
    - each file is some piece of code
    - each code is a sequence of instructions
- problems with this approach
    - easy for small-scale problems, but messy for large-scale
    - hard to keep track of details
    - how do you ensure the right info is supplied to the right part of code

---
### Good Programming
---

- more code not necessarily a good thing  
- measure good programmers by the amount of functionality  
- introduce **functions** -- lets you encapsulate pieces of computation  
    - mechanism to achieve **decomposition** and **abstraction**

> - Abstraction
>     - black box
>     - don't need to know how something works to use it, and using it just means understanding the interface, the I/O 
>     - i.e., suppress details of method to compute something through use of that computation  

> - Decompostion
>     - have different devices work together to achieve an end goal
>     - i.e., break problem into different, self-contained pieces

---
### Create Structure With Decomposition
---

- in programming, we divide our code into **modules**
    - **self-contained**
    - used to **break up** code
    - intended to be **reusable**
    - keep code **organized**
    - keep code **coherent**
- this lecture, we'll achieve decomposition through **functions**, but in a few weeks, we will do so with **classes**

---
### Suppress Details With Abstraction
---

- think of a piece of code as a "black box" of sorts
    - cannot see details
    - do not need to see details
    - do not want to see details
    - hide hideous coding details
- achieve abstraction with **function specifications** or **docstrings**

---

## 2.6 Introducing Functions

**Functions** give us the ability to write reusable pieces of code
- functions aren't run in a program until they are *called* or *invoked* in a program
- function characteristics:
    - has a **name**
    - has **parameters** (0 or more)
    - has a **docstring** (optional but recommended)
    - has a **body** (sequence of commands or instructions to execute on function call)

`def` keyword tells Python interpreter that we're about to *define* something  

Example of a docstring snippet (comment block specifying the input and output of the function, for the sake of readability):
```python
"""

Input: i, a positive int

Returns True if i is even, otherwise False

"""
```

- Writing and calling/invoking a function:
    - `def` keyword
    - name
    - parameters or arguments
    - specification, docstring (also indented)
    - body
- later in the code, you call the function using its name and values for parameters

A **docstring**, more formally, is a special type of comment that is used to document what your function is doing.  
Typically, explains what the function expects the type(s) of the argument(s) to be, and what the function is returning.  
- can be triple single quotes or triple double quotes (doesn't matter so long as they match)

---

## 2.7 Calling Functions and Scope

---
### Variable Scope
---

- **formal parameter** gets bound to the value of **actual parameter** when function is called
- new **scope/frame/environment created when you enter a function
- **scope** is mapping of names to objects

Any time I invoke a function, I create a new frame.  I bind the formal parameter(s) of that function to the values of the expressions passed in.  
Relative to that frame, now, I evaluate the body of that expression.  When done with the body of the function, if there's a return, send the value back to whomever called for it, subsequently erasing or removing that frame because I no longer need it.  

If we don't include a `return` statement, Python returns the value `None`, which represents the absence of a value.  
Point being, anytime we want a function to do something **beyond side-effects**, we want to always have at least one return statement that gives a value back.  

---
### `return` Vs. `print`
---

- `return`
    - only has meaning **inside** a function
    - only **one** return executed within a function
    - code inside function but after a return statement doesn't get executed
    - has a value associated with it which is **given** to the **function caller**

- `print`
    - can be used **outside** functions
    - can execute **many** print statements inside a function
    - code inside function can be executed after a print statement
    - has a value associated with it, and this is **output** to the console

---
### Functions As Arguments
---

- arguments can take on any type, **even functions**

---
### Scope Example
---

- inside a function, **can access** a variable defined outside
- inside a functions, **cannot modify** a variable defined outside

---

## 2.8 Keyword Arguments

- Can specify that some arguments have default values, so if no value is supplied, just default to using that value

---

## 2.9 Specification

- a **contract** between the implementer of a function and the clients who will use it
    - **Assumptions**: conditions that must be met by clients of the function; typically constraints on values of parameters
    - **Guarantees**: conditions that must be met by function, providing it has been called in a manner consistent with assumptions

Of course you're not required to put in a docstring or a spec for your functions, but good programmers always do.  
You never know.  You may return to a function after 2, 5 years and, if you wrote a docstrings and specs, you can better understand how you were thinking when you built that module.  

---

## 2.10 Iteration Vs. Recursion

---
### What Is Recursion?
---

- a way to design solutions to problemsby **divide-and-conquer** or **decrease and conquer**
- a programming technique where a function ***calls itself***
- in programming, you want to avoid-like-the-plague the idea of infinite recursion
    - need one or more **base cases** that are easy to solve
    - must solve the same problem on some **other input** with the goal of simplifying the larger problem input

---
### Iterative Algorithms ... So Far ...
---

- looping constructs (while and for loops) lead to **iterative** algorithms
- can capture computation in a set of **state variables** that update on each iteration through the loop

---
### Recursion
---

- recursive **step**
    - think how to reduce a problem to a **simpler/smaller version** of the same problem
- **base case**
    - keep reducing the problem until you reach a simple case that can be **solved directly**

---
### Factorial
---

n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 1

- what `n` do we know the factorial of?
- how do we reduce this problem?  rewrite it in terms of something simpler to reach base case?

---
### Some Observations
---

- each call to a function creates its own **scope/environment**
- **binding variable** in a scope is not changed by recursive call
- flow control of passes back to **previous scope** once function call returns a value
    - use the same variable names, but they are different objects in the contexts of different scopes

Iterative:
```python
def factorial_iter(n):
    prod = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1)
        prod *= i
    return prod
```

Recursive:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)
```

- recursion may be simpler, more intuitive
- recursion for brevity may be great for programmer
- recursion for complexity may not be as great in some cases
- still, each of these things does the same thing -- you get to decide which you utilize

---

## 2.11 Inductive Reasoning

How do we know our recursive code is going to work?  How do we set it up so that we know execution will stop?  

---
### Mathematical Induction
---

- To prove a statement indexed on integers is true for all values of n:
    - prove it is true when n is smallest value (e.g., n=0 or n=1)
    - then prove that if it is true for an arbitrary value of n, one can show that it must be true for n+1

Relevance to code?  
- the same logic applies:
```python
def mult(a, b):
    if b == 1:
        return a
    else:
        return a + mult(a, b-1)
```

## 2.12 Towers Of Hanoi

---
### Towers Of Hanoi
---

- the story:
    - 3 tall spikes
    - stack of 64 discs of ascending diameter
    - start on one spike -> need to move stack to a second spike
    - can only move one disc at a time; larger disk can never cover a smaller disc

- move a stack of size `n-1` onto the spare disc
- then I've got just one disc left on the bottom -- we move this one onto the target because it's a simpler problem
- then we move that stack to that we had moved temporarily to the third spike to the target spike

```python
def printMove(fr, to):
    print('Move from ' + str(fr) + ' to ' + str(to))

def Towers(n, fr, to, spare):
    if n == 1:
        printmove(fr, to)
    else:
        Towers(n-1, fr, spare, to)
        Towers(1, fr, to, spare)
        Towers(n-1, spare, to, fr)
```

- Two lessons from this example:
    - first is that we can have multiple recursive calls inside a function body
    - second is that this is an example of a problem that's REALLY difficult to solve iteratively, but is rather easy and elegant to solve with recursion

Think about this notion
- break your problem down into a smaller version of the same problem
- assume it can be solved
- build your solution with that and other simple operations
- let recursion then unwind it to get the solution that you want

## 2.13 Fibonacci

---
### Recursion With Multiple Base Cases
---

- Fibonacci Numbers
    - Leonardo de Pisa (aka Fibonacci) modeled the following challenge:
        - newborn pair of rabbits (one female, one male) are put in a pen
        - rabbits mate at age one month
        - rabbits have one month gestation period
        - assume rabbits never die, that females always produce one new pair (one male, one female) every month from its second month on
        - how many female rabbits are there at the end of a year?

---
### Fibonacci
---

- After one month (call it 0) - 1 female  
- After second month - still 1 female (now pregnant)
- After third month - two females, one pregnant, one not
- In general, females(n) = females(n-1) + females(n-2)
    - Every female alive at month n-2 will produce one female in month n
        - These can be added to those alive in month n-1 to get total alive in month n
- Base cases:
    - Females(0) = 1
    - Females(1) = 1
- Recursive case:
    - Females(n) = Females(n-1) + Females(n-2)
    - requires *two* invocations of the function (one for (n-1, and one for (n-1))

| Month | Females |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 |
| 5 | 8 |
| 6 | 13 |

## 2.14 Recursion On Non-numerics

- How to check if a string is a palindrome?  
    - first, we want to convert the string to just characters, by stripping out punctuation, converting uppercase to lowercase
    - then:
        - base case: a string of length 0 or 1 is a palindrome
        - recursive case: if character matches last character, then it's a palindrome if middle section is a palindrome

```python
def isPalidrome(s):
    def toChar(s):
        s = s.lower()
        ans = ''
        for c in s:
            if c.isalpha():
                ans = ans + c
        return ans

    def isPal(s):
        if len(s) <= 1:
            return True
        else:
            return s[0] == s[-1] and isPal(s[1:-1])
    
    return isPal(toChar(s))
```

---
### Divide And Conquer
---

- class of algorithms
- solve a hard problem by breaking it into a set of sub-problems that:
    - are easier to solve
    - can be combined to solve the problem at large

---

## 2.15 Files

---
### Modules And Files
---

These are how we 

- we have assumed so far that our code is stored in one file
    - this is cumbersome for large collections of code, or for code that should be used by many different other pieces of programming
    - a **module** is a `.py` file containing a collection Python definitions and statements

---
### Example Module
---

- the file `circle.py` contains:
```python
pi = 3.14159
def area(radius):
    return pi*(radius**2)
def circumference(radius):
    return 2*pi*radius
```
- then we can import and use this module:
```python
import circle
pi = 3
print(pi)
print(circle.pi)
print(circle.area)
print(circle.area(3))
print(circle.circumference(3))
```
- results in the following being printed:
```python
3
3.14159
28.27431
18.849539999999998
```
---
- if we don't want to refer to functions and variables by their module, and the names don't collide with other bindings, then we can use:
```python
from circle import *    # import everything from circle

print(pi)

print(area(3))
```
- this has the effect of creating bindings within the current scope for all objects defined within `circle`
- statements within a module are executed only the first time a module is imported

---
### Files
---

- need a way to save our work for later use
    - every OS has its own way of handling files; Python provides an OS-independent means to access files, using a **file handle**
```python
nameHandle = open('leaves', 'w')
```
- creates a file named `leaves` and returns file handle which we can name and thus reference
- the `w` indicates that the file is to open for *writing* into
```python
nameHandle = open('leaves', 'w')
for i in range(2):
    name = input('Enter name: ')
    nameHandle.write(name + '\')
nameHandle.close()
```
- similarly, we can read from the file with `r`
```python
nameHandle = open('leaves', 'r')
for line in nameHandle:
    print(line)
nameHandle.close()
```
- use files and modules to ***control*** the  ***complexity*** of the systems that you build
