### Strings, Tuples, Ranges, And Lists
---

| common operations |  |
| --- | --- |
| `seq[i]` | *i*th element of a sequence |
| `len(seq)` | length of a sequence |
| `seq1 + seq2` | concatenation of sequences (cannot concatenate ranges) |
| `n*seq` | sequence that repeats `seq`, `n` times (again, cannot concatenate range) |
| `seq[start:end]` | slice of a sequence |
| `e in seq` | `True` if `e` contained in sequence |
| `e not in seq` | `False` if `e` contained in sequence |
| `for e in seq` | iterates over elements of a sequence |

---
### Properties

| Type | Type of Elements | Examples of literals | Mutable? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| str | characters | `' '`, `'a'`, `'abc'` | No |
| tuple | any type | `()`, `(3,)`, `('abc', 4)` | No |
| range | integers | `range(10)`, `range(1, 10, 2`) | No |
| list | any type | `[]`, `[3]`, `['abc', 4]` | Yes |

## 3.6 Dictionaries

Let's start with an example
: storing data about students in a database

---
### How To Store Student Info

- so far, can store using separate lists for every piece of information
```python
names = ['Ana', 'John', 'Denise', 'Katy']
grade = ['B', 'A+', 'A', 'A']
course = [2.00, 6.0001, 20.002, 9.01]
```
- a **separate** list for each item
- each list must have the **same length**
- info stored **across lists** at the **same index**, each index referring to info pertaining to a different student (Ana is index 0 of each list, for example)
- if we wanted to write a function to get information out of these lists...
    - **messy** if we have a lot of different pieces of information to track
    - must maintain **many lists** and pass them as arguments
    - must **always index** using integers
    - must remember to change multiple lists
```python
def get_grade(student, name_list, grade_list, course_list):
    i = name_list.index(student)
    grade = grade.list[i]
    course = course_list[i]
    return (course, grade)
```

---
### A Better And Cleaner Way - Dictionaries
---

- nice to **index item of interest directly** (not always int)
- nice to use **one data structure**, no separate lists

| a list |  |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Elem 1 |
| 1 | Elem 3 |
| 2 | Elem 3 |
| 3 | Elem 4 |
| ... | Elem ... |

| a dictionary |  |
| --- | --- |
| Key 1 | Val 1 |
| Key 2 | Val 2 |
| Key 3 | Val 3 |
| Key 4 | Val 4 |
| Key ... | Val ... |

- dictionaries let you customize how you index into a collection
    - rather than saying, give me the *0*th element, we say to give me the element associated with this key
    - these keys are our indices, and we use them as labels that tell me where to find the element inside of the dictionary
- we lose the *linear structure* that we have with lists, but we gain great power in terms of how we can retrieve elements out of our data structure

---
### Python Dictionaries
---

- store key-value pairs data
```python
# empty dictionary
my_dict = {}

grades = {'Ana':'B', 'John':'A+', 'Denise':'A', 'Katy':'A'}
```

---
### Dictionary Lookup
---

- similar to indexing into a list
- **looks up** a **key**
- **returns** the **value** associated with the key
- if key isn't found, get an error
    - `grades['John']` -> evals to `'A+'`
    - `grades['Sylvan']` -> evals to `KeyError`

---
### Dictionary Operations
---

- **add** an entry
    - dictionaries are **mutable**
    - `grades['Sylvan'] = 'A'`
- **test** if key in dictionary
    - `'John' in grades` -> returns `True`
    - `'Daniel' in grades` -> returns `False`
- **delete** an entry
    - `del(grades['Ana'])`
- get an **iterable** that **acts like a tuple of all keys** (without guaranteeing a particular order (depends on how you entered items))
    - `grades.keys()` -> returns `['Denise', 'Katy', 'John', 'Ana']`
- get an **iterable** that **acts like a tuple of all values** (without guaranteeing a particular order (depends on how you entered items))
    - `grades.values()` -> returns `['A', 'A', 'A+', 'B']`

---
### Dictionary Keys And Values
---

- values
    - any type (**immutable** and **mutable**)
    - can exist **duplicates** (same value(s) associated with different keys)
    - dictionary values can be lists, or even other dictionaries
- keys
    - must be **unique**
    - **immutable** type (`int`, `float`, `string`, `tuple`, `bool`)
        - actually need an object that is **hashable**, but think of as immutable as all immutable types are hashable
    - careful with `float` type as a key (if the float has an accuracy issue, we might not find the things we wanted to associate with it)
- **no order** to keys or values!

---
### Lists Vs. Dictionaries
---

| `list` | `dict` |
| --- | --- |
| **ordered** sequence of elements | **matches** "keys" to "values" |
| look up elements by an integer index | look up one item by another item |
| indices have an **order** | **no order** is guaranteed |
| index is an **integer** | key can be any **immutable** type |

## 3.7 Example With A Dictionary

---
### Example: Three Functions To Analyze Song Lyrics
---

1. create a **frequency dictionary** mapping `str:int`
2. find a **word that occurs the most** and how many times
    - use a list, in case there is more than one word
    - return a tuple `(list, int)` for words `(words_list, highest_freq)`
3. find the **words that occur at least *X* times**
    - let user choose "at least *X* times"
    - return a list of tuples, each tuple is a `(list, int)` containing the list of words ordered by their frequency
    - idea: from the song dictionary, find the most frequently used word; delete most common word; repeat (this works because you're mutating the song dictionary)

---
### Creating A Dictionary
---

```python
def lyrics_to_frequencies(lyrics):
    myDict = {}
    for word in lyrics:
        if word in myDict:
            myDict[word] += 1
        else:
            myDict[word] = 1
    return myDict
```

---
### Using The Dictionary
---

```python
def most_common_words(freqs):
    values = freqs.values()
    best = max(values)
    words = []
    for k in freqs:
        if freqs[k] == best:
            words.append(k)
    return (words, best)
```

---
### Leveraging Dictionary Properties
---

```python
def words_often(freqs, minTimes):
    result = []
    done = False
    while not done:
        temp = most_common_words(freqs)
        if temp[1] >= minTimes:
            result.append(temp)
            for w in temp[0]:
                del(freqs[w])
        else:
            done = True
    return result
```

## 3.8 Fibonacci And Dictionaries

This is a good example of a problem where a dictionary is an incredibly valuable thing to have at your disposal.  

---
### Fibonacci Recursive Code
---

```python
def fib(n):
    if n ==1:
        return 1
    elif n ==2:
        return 2:
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
- two base cases
- calls itself twice
- this code is inefficient  
    - each function call includes two more, and the same values are being computed over and over (values we already know after first computation)
        - this is where a dictionary could provide some welcome help: rather than recalculating the same values many times, let's keep track of what we compute

---
### Fibonacci With A Dictionary
---

```python
def fib_efficient(n, d):
    if n in d:
        return d[n]
    else:
        ans = find_efficient(n-1, d) + fib_efficient(n-2, d)
        d[n] = ans
        return ans

d = {1:1, 2:2}
print(fib_efficient(6, d))
```
- do a **lookup first** in case we already calculated the value
- **modify dictionary** as progress through function calls

---

## 3.9 Global Variables

- can be dangerous to use
    - breaks scoping of variables by function call
    - allows for side effects of changing variable values in ways that affect other computation
- but can be convenient when want to keep track of information inside a function
- example--measuring how often `fib` and `fib_efficient` are called

Globals are something that computer scientists don't like to use as they can lead to really lead to side effects in a very bad way.  
In some cases, they're highly valuable.  

Indexing on arbitrary keys is the idea we want to generalize in the form of procedures.
