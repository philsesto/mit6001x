## Recap

---
### Reviewing Strings
---

- think of as a sequence of case-sensitive characters
- can compare strings using `==`, `<=`, `>=` operators, etc.
- `len()` is a function used to retrieve the `length` of the string in parentheses
- square brackets used to perform **indexing** into a string to get the value at a certain index/position 
- can **slice** strings using `[start:stop:step]`
- strings are **immutable** -- cannot be modified

## 2.1 Approximate Solutions

- Suppose we now want to find the root of any non-negative number?
- can't guarantee an exact answer, but just look for something close
- start with exhaustive enumeration
    - take small steps to generate guesses in order
    - check to see if close enough

- **good enough** solutions
- start with a guess anad increment by some **small value**
- ex., `abs(guess**3)-cube <= epsilon` for some small **epsilon**
- tradeoff:
    - decreasing increment size results in a slower program
    - increasing epsilon resutes in a less accurate answer
- advantage:
    - now we can approximate the cube root as a float and find the cube roots that aren't "perfect" integers
    
```python
cube = 29
epsilon = 0.01
guess = 0.0
increment = 0.01
num_guesses = 0
while abs(guess**3 - cube) >= epsilon and guess <= cube:
    guess += increment
    num_guesses += 1
print('num_guesses =', num_guesses)
if abs(guess**3 - cube) >= epsilon:
    print('Failed on the cube root of', cube)
else:
    print(guess, 'is close to the cube root of', cube)
```

---
### Some Observations
---

- Step could be any small number
    - if too small, takes a long time to execute code
    - if too large, might skip over the answer without getting close enough
- in general, will take x/step times through code to find solution
    - need a more efficient way to do this

---

## 2.2 Bisection Search

- we know that the square root lies between 1 and x from mathematics
- rather than exhaustively trying things starting at 1, suppose we instead pick a number in the middle of this range
    - if we are lucky, this answer is close enough
    - if not close enough, was that guess too big or too small?
    - now we repeat, picking a number in the middle of the decided range and asking the question over again
    - repeat until you've converged on the search item

```python
x = 25
epsilon = 0.01
numGuesses = 0
low = 0.0
high = x
ans = (high+low)/2.0

while abs(ans**2 - x) >= epsilon:
    print('low = ' + str(low) + ' high = ' + str(high) + ' ans = ' + str(ans))
    numGuesses += 1
    if ans**2 < x:
        low = ans
    else:
        high = ans
    ans = (high + low)/2.0
print('numGuesses = ' + str(numGuesses))
print(str(ans) + ' is close to the square root of ' + str(x))
```
```python
x = 27
epsilon = 0.01
numGuesses = 0
low = 0.0
high = x
ans = (high+low)/2.0

while abs(ans**3 - x) >= epsilon:
    print('low = ' + str(low) + ' high = ' + str(high) + ' ans = ' + str(ans))
    numGuesses += 1
    if ans**3 < x:
        low = ans
    else:
        high = ans
    ans = (high + low)/2.0
print('numGuesses = ' + str(numGuesses))
print(str(ans) + ' is close to the square root of ' + str(x))
```

### Bisection Search Convergence
---

- search space
    - first guess: `N/2`
    - second guess: `N/4`
    - gth guess: `N/2**g`
- guess converges on the order of log base 2 of N steps
    - logarithmic-time algorithm
- bisection search works when value of function varies monotonically with input
- code as shown only works for positive cubes greater than 1 -- why is that?
- challenges:
    - modify to work with negative cubes
    - modify to work with `x < 1`

For `x < 1`:  
- if `x < 1`, search space is `0` to `x` but cube root is greate than `x` and less than `1`
- modify the code to choose the search space depending on the value of `x`

---
### Some Observations
---

- Bisection search drastically reduces computation time -- being smart about generating guesses is important
- Should work well on problems with "ordering" property -- value of a function being solved varies monotonically with input value
    - here function is `g**2`; which grows as `g` grows

## 2.3 Floats And Fractions

---
### Dealing With `float`s
---

- floats approximate real numbers, but it's useful to understand how:
    - decimal numbers are base-10
    - binary numbers are base-2
    - internally, computers represent numbers in binary

---
### Converting Decimal Integer To Binary
---

```python
if num < 0:
    isNeg = True
    num = abs(num)
else:
    isNeg = False
result = ''
if num == 0:
    result = '0'
while num > 0:
    result = str(num%2) + result
    num = num//2
if isNeg:
    result = '-' + result
```

---
### What About Fractions?
---

- `3/8 == 0.375 == (3 * 10**-1) + (7 * 10**-2) + (5 * 10**-3)`
- so if we multiply by a power of 2 big enough to convert into a whole number, can then convert to binary and then divide by the same power of 2
- `0.375 * (2**3) == 3` (decimal)
- convert `3` to binary (now `11`)
- divide by `2**3` (shift right) to get `0.011` (binary)

---
### Some Implications
---

- if there is no integer `p` such that `x*(2**p)` is a whole number, then internal representation is always an approximation
- testing equality of floats is not exact
    - use `abs(x-y) < small_number` rather than `x == y`
- why does print(0.1) have the side effect of printing the exact float?
    - Python designers set it up this way; automatically rounds

---

## 2.4 Newton-Raphson

- General approximation algorithm to find roots of a polynomial in one variable  
- Want to find *r* such that p(r) = 0  
- For example, to find the square root of 24, find the root of p(x) = x**2 - 24  
- Newton showed that if *g* is an approximation to the root, then g - p(g)/p'(g) is a better approxmiation (where p' is the derivative of p)  

- Simple case: `c*x**2 + k`
    - first derivative: `2*c*x`
    - so if polynomial is `x**2 + k`, then derivative is `2x`
- Newton-Raphson says that, given a guess g for root, a better guess is `g-((g**2-k)/2*g)`

```python
epsilon = 0.01
y = 24.0
guess = y/2.0
numGuesses = 0

while abs(guess*guess - y) >= epsilon:
    numGuesses += 1
    guess -= (guess**2 - y) / 2*guess
print('numGuesses is ' + str(numGuesses))
print('Square root of ' + str(y) + ' is about ' + str(guess))
```

---
### Iterative Algorithms
---

- Guess and check methods build on reusing the same code
    - use a looping construct to generate guesses, then check and continue
- Generating guesses
    - exhaustive enumeration
    - bisection search
    - Newton-Raphson (for finding roots)
