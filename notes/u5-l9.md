## 5.1 OOP

Creating classes of objects that you as the user can define adds tremendous power, flexibility, and capability to our language and our ability to create new systems.  

---
### Objects
---

- Python supports many different kinds of data:
    - ints, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and so on
- each is an instance of an **object**, and every object has:
    - a **type**
    - an internal **data representation** (primitive or composite)
    - a set of procedures for **interaction** with the object
- each **instance** is a particular type of object
    - `1234` is an instance of `int`
    - `a = 'hello'`
        - `a` is an instance of a string

---
### OOP
---

- everything in Python is an **object** and has a **type**
- objects are **data abstraction** that captures:
    - internal **representation** through data attributes
    - **interface** for interacting with object through methods (procedures), defines behaviors but hides implementation
- can **create new instances** of objects
- can **destroy** objects
    - explicitly using `del` or just "forget" about them
    - Python system will reclaim destroyed or inaccessible objects -- called "garbage collection"

---
### Standard Data Objects
---

- some object types, as we know, are built-into Python
- we *want* to be able to explore the ability to create **our own data object types**
    - we do this in order to abstract those concepts we use to build our data type

---
### Example: [1,2,3,4]
---

- `[1,2,3,4]` is of type `list`
- how are lists represented **internally**?
    - as a linked list of cells
        - turns out that setting up lists by just arranging the data consecutively in memory limits our ability to change them, mutate them, or to have arbitrary-sized elements inside of them
        - for this reason, we use linked lists
            - list points to a *pair* of cells in memory, the first one of which contains either the object or perhaps a pointer to an object elsewhere, and the second which points to, i.e. *links*, to the next location in the list
- this is a nice way to think about building lists
    - is it the way you do it, though?
        - doesn't matter, because what you use with the lists is a way, a set of procedures, a set of methods, to actually manipulate the elements of the list
            - i.e., we can get out a specific element, you can slice into it, can have procedures that actually compute things off a list or get rid of an element altogether
- how to **manipulate** lists?
    - `L[i]`, `L[i:j]`, `L[i,j,k]`, `+`
    - `len()`, `min()`, `max()`, `del(L[i])`
    - `L.append()`, `L.extend()`, `L.count()`, `L.index()`
    - `L.insert()`, `L.pop()`, `L.remove()`, `L.reverse()`, `L.sort()`

- internal representation should be ***private***
- correct behavior may be compromised if you manipulate intenal representation directly
    - **use defined interfaces**

---
### Creating And Using Your Own Objects With Classes
---

- internal representation + methods to enable us to talk about how we want to manipulate that internal representation

- make a distinction between **creating a class** and **using an instance** of the class
- **creating** a class involves
    - defining the class **name**
    - defining class **attributes**
    - for example, someone wrote code to implement a list class
- **using** this class involves
    - creating new instances of objects
    - doing operations on the instances
    - for example, L=[1,2] and len(L)

---
### Advantages Of OOP
---

- **bundle data into packages** together with procedures that work on them through well-defined interfaces
    - abstraction -- can treat the whole contained structure as an element
- **divide-and-conquer development**
    - implement and test behavior of each class separately
    - increased modularity reduces complexity
- classes make it easy to **reuse** code
    - many Python modules define new classes
    - each class has a separate environment (no collision on function names)
    - inheritance allows subclasses to redefine or extend a selected subset of a superclass' behavior

---

## 5.2 Class Instances

---
### Define Your Own Types
---

- use the `class` keyword to define a new type
```python
class Coordinate(object):
    <define attribute values here>
```
- similar to `def`, indent code to indicate which statements are a part of the **class definition**
- the word `object` means that `Coordinate` is a Python object and **inherits** all its attributes (coming soon)
    - `Coordinate` is a subclass of `object`
    - `object` is a superclass of `Coordinate`

---
### What Are Attributes?
---

- data and procedures that "**belong**" to the class
- **data** attributes
    - think of as other objects that make up the class
    - for example, a coordinate is made up of two numbers
- procedural attributes (**methods**)
    - think of as functions that only work with this class
    - for example, you can define a distance between two coordinate objects, but there is no meaning to a distance between two list objects

---
### Defining How To Create An Instance Of A Class
---

- first have to define **how to create an instance** of object
- use a **special method called `__init__` to initialize some data attributes
```python
class Coordinate(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
```
- when we invoke creation of an instance, this will bind the variables x and y within that instance to the supplied values

---
### Actually Creating A Class
---

```python
c = Coordinate(3,4)
origin = Coordinate(0,0)
print(c.x)
print(origin.x)
```
- data attributes of an instance are called **instance variables**
- don't provide argument for `self`, Python does this automatically
    - self automatically points to the instance we created
- think of `c` as pointing to a frame (like we saw with function calls)
    - within the scope of that frame, we bound values to data attribute values
    - `c.x` is interpreted as getting the value of `c` (a frame) and then looking up the value associated with `x` within that frame (thus the specific value for this instance)
    
---

## 5.3 Methods

---
### What Is A Method?
---

- procedural attribute, like a **function that only works with a class**
- Python always passes the actual object as the first argument, convention is to use `self` as the name of the first argument of all methods
- the **"." operator** is used to access any attribute
    - data attributes of an object
    - methods of an object

---
### Define A Method For The `Coordinate` Class
---

```python
class Coordinate(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    def distance(self, other):
        x_diff_sq(self.x-other.x)**2
        y_diff_sq(self.y-other.y)**2
        return (x_diff_sq + y_diff_sq)**0.5
```
- other than `self` and dot notation, methods behave just like functions (take params, do operations, return value)

---
### How To Use A Method From The `Coordinate` Class
---

`def distance(self, other)`
- conventional way:
    - object on which to call method
    - name of method
    - parameters not including `self` (`self` is implied to be `c`)
```python
c = Coordinate(3,4)
origin = Coordinate(0,0)
print(c.distance(origin))
```
- equivalent to:
    - name of class
    - name of method
    - parameters, including an object on which to call the method representing `self`
```python
c = Coordinate(3,4)
origin = Coordinate(0,0)
print(Coordinate.distance(c, origin))
```
- think of `Coordinate` as pointing to a frame
    - within the scope of that frame, we created methods
    - `Coordinate.distance` gets the value of `Coordinate`, a frame, then looks up the value associated with `distance` (a procedure), then invokes it (which requires two arguments)
    - `c.distance` inherits `distance` from the class definition, and automatically uses `c` as the first argument

---
### Print Representation Of An Object
---

```python
>>> c = Coordinate(3,4)
>>> print(c)
<__main__.Coordinate object at 0x7fa918510488>
```
- **uninformative** print representation by default
- define a **`__str__` method** for a class
- Python calls the `__str__` method when used with a `print` on your class object
- you choose what it does!
    - say that when we print a `Coordinate` object, want to show:
```python
>>> print(c)
<3,4>
```
- how do we do this? 
```python
class Coordinate(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
def distance(self, other):
        x_diff_sq(self.x-other.x)**2
        y_diff_sq(self.y-other.y)**2
        return (x_diff_sq + y_diff_sq)**0.5
def __str__(self):
    return '<' + str(self.x) + ',' + str(self.y) + '>'        
```

---
### Wrapping Your Head Around Types And Classes
---

- can ask for the type of an object instance
-  use `isinstance` method to check if an object is a particular class of object
    `print(isinstance(c, Coordinate))` prints `True`

---
### Special Operators
---

- `+`, `-`, `==`, `<`, `>`, `len()`, `print()`, and many others
- refer to documentation

- like `print`, we can override these to work with your class
- define them with double underscores before/after
```python
__add__(self, other)    # self + other
__sub__(self, other)    # self - other
__eq__(self, other)     # self == other
__lt__(self, other)     # self < other
__len__(self)           # len(self)
__str__(self)           # print(self)
# and more...
```

---

## 5.4 Classes Examples

---
### Example: Fractions
---

- create a **new type** to represent a number as a fraction
- **internal representation** is two integers
    - numerator
    - denominator
- **interface** a.k.a. **methods** a.k.a. **how to interact** with `Fraction` objects
    - print representation
    - add, subtract
    - convert to float

---
### Initial Fraction Class
---

```python
class fraction(object):
    def __init__(self, numer, denom):
        self.numer = numer
        self.denom = denom
    def __str__(sef):
        return str(self.numer) + ' / ' + str(self.denom)
```
- now the idea needs to be that we will create something that will allow me to access data attributes
    - these are often called *getters*, because they get elements out of that
- here we're going to define a getter for the numerator and a getter for the denominator, giving them obvious names 
```python
class fraction(object):
    def __init__(self, numer, denom):
        self.numer = numer
        self.denom = denom
    def __str__(sef):
        return str(self.numer) + ' / ' + str(self.denom)
    def getNumer(self):
        return self.numer
    def getDenom(self):
        return self.denom
```
- we can now define things like how to add fractions, how to subtract them, and how to convert them to floats
```python
class fraction(object):
    def __init__(self, numer, denom):
        self.numer = numer
        self.denom = denom
    def __str__(sef):
        return str(self.numer) + ' / ' + str(self.denom)
    def getNumer(self):
        return self.numer
    def getDenom(self):
        return self.denom
    def __add__(self, other):
        numerNew = other.getDenom() * self.getNumer() + other.getNumer() * self.getDenom()
        denomNew = other.getDenom() * self.getDenom()
        return fraction(numerNew, denomNew)
    def __sub__(self, other):
        numerNew = other.getDenom() * self.getNumer() - other.getNumer() * self.getDenom()
        denomNew = other.getDenom() * self.getDenom()
        return fraction(numerNew, denomNew)
```
- these methods create **new** instances of fractions by doing arithmetic operations on them per our definitions

---
### Example: A Set Of Integers
---

- create a new type to represent a **collection of integers**
    - initially, the set it empty
    - a particular integer appears only once in a set: **representational invariant** enforced by the code
- internal data representation
    - use a list to store the elements of a set
- **interface**
    - `insert(e)` -- insert integer `e` into set if not there
    - `member(e)` -- return `True` if integer `e` is in set, `False` else
    - `remove(e)` -- remove integer `e` from set, error if not present

- remember that we want to separate the use of an object from what's inside it
    - we don't want to directly manipulate the internal representation of an object

---
### Integer Set Class
---

```python
class intSet(object):
    """
    An intSet is a set of integers
    The value represented by a list of ints, self.vals
    Each int in the set occurs in self.vals no more than once
    """
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Create an empty set of integers
        """
        self.vals = []

    def inser(self, e):
        """
        Assumes e is an integer and inserts e into self
        """
        if e not in self.vals:
            self.vals.append(e)

    def member(self, e):
        """
        Assumes e is an integer, returns True if e is in self and otherwise returns False
        """
        return e in self.vals

    def remove(self, e):
        """
        Assumes e is an integer and removes e from self, raising ValueError if e is not in self
        """
        try:
            self.vals.remove(e)
        except:
            raise ValueError(str(e) + ' not found')

    def __str__(self):
        """
        Returns a string representation of self
        """
        self.vals.sort()
        result = ''
        for e in self.vals:
            result = result + str(e) + ','
        return '{' + result[:-1] + '}'
```
- so notice how we define, when creating a class:
    - an `__init__` method
    - a string method
    - then create methods specific to this kind of class that will let me manipulate instances of that class

---

## 5.5 Why OOP?

---
### The Power Of OOP
---

- **bundle together objects** that share
    - common attributes
    - procedures that operate on those attributes
- use **abstraction** to make a distinction between how to implement an object vs how to use that object
- build **layers** of object abstractions that inherit behaviors from other classes of objects
- create our own **classes of objects** on top of Python's basic classes, treat as primitives

---
### Implementing The Class Versus Using The Class
---

- write code from two different perspectives
- all class examples we saw so far were numerical

> - **implementing** a new object type with a class
>     - **define** the class
>     - define **data attributes** (what *is* the object)
>     - define methods (how to *use* the object)
> - **using** the new object type in code
>     - create **instances** of the object type
>     - do **operations** with them

---
### Class Definition Of An Object Versus Instance Of A Class
---

- class is the **type**
    - a `Coordinate` type
    - `class Coordinate(object):`
- class is defined generically
    - use `self` to refer to any instance while defining the class
- class defines data and methods **common across all instances**

- instance is **one particular** object
    - `mycoo = Coordinate(1,2)`
- data values vary between instances
    - `c1 = Coordinate(1,2)`
    - `c2 = Coordinate(3,4)`
    - `c1` and `c2` have different data values because they are different objects
- instance has the **structure of the class**

---
### Why Use OOp And Classes Of Objects?
---

- mimic real life
- group different objects as part of the same type

---
### Groups Of Objects Have Attributes
---

- **data attributes**
    - how can you represent your object with data?
    - what it is
        - for a coordinate, x and y values
        - for an animal, age and name or other
- **procedural attributes** (behavior/operations/methods)
    - what kinds of things can you do with the object?
    - **what it does**
        - for a coordinate, find distance between two
        - for an animal, make a sound

---
### Getter And Setter Methods
---

```python
class Animal(object):
    def __init(self, age):
        self.age = age
        self.name = None
    def get_age(self):
        return self.age
    def get_name(self):
        return self.name
    def set_age(self, newage):
        self.age = newage
    def set_name(self, newname=""):
        self.name = newname
    def __str__(self):
        return "animal:" + str(self.name) + ":" + str(self.age)
```
- **getters and setters** should be used outside of class to access data attributes

---
### An Instance And Dot Notation
---

- instantiation creates an **instance** of an object
    - `a = Animal(3)`
- **dot notation** used to access attributes (data and methods) though it is better to use getters and setters to access data attributes
    - `a.age`
        - access data attribute
    - `a.get_age()`
        - acess and **use** method

---
### Information Hiding
---

- author of class definition may **change data attribute** variable names
```python
class Animal(object):
    def __init__(self, age):
        self.years = age
    def get_age(self):
        return self.years
```
- if you are **accessing data attributes** outside the class and class **definition changes**, you may get errors
    - outside of class, use getters and setters instead
        - use `a.get_age()` NOT `a.age`
    - good style
    - easy to maintain code
    - prevents bugs

---
### Python Not Great At Information Hiding
---

- allows you to **access data** from outside class definition
    - `print(a.age)`
- allows you to **write to data** from outside class definition
    - `a.age = 'infinite'`
- allows you to **create data attributes** for an instance from outside class definition
    - `a.size = "tiny"`
- it's **not good style** to do any of these!

---
### `self` And Other Args
---

- **`self` determined from instance**, passed in as argument
    - for the method: `def __init__(self, age)`
        - creates `self`, passes it in as argument
        - `a = Animal(3)`
    - for the method: `def get_age(self)`
        - call method with `a.get_age()`
        - or an alternate way `Animal.get_age(a)`
- **default arguments** for formal parameters are used if no actual argument is given
    - for the method: `def set_name(self, newname="")`
        - default argument used here: `a.set_name()`
        - argument passed is used here: `a.set_name("fluffy")`


---

## 5.6 Hierarchies

- **parent class** (superclass)
- **child class** (subclass)
    - **inherits** all data and behavior of parent class
    - **add** more **information**
    - **add** more **behavior**
    - **override** behavior

---
### Inheritance
---

```python
class Animal(object):
    def __init__(self, age):
        self.age = age
        self.name = None
    def get_age
        return self.age
    def get_name(self):
        return self.name
    def set_age(self, newage):
        self.age = newage
    def set_name(self, newname=""):
        self.name = newname
    def __str__(self):
        return "animal:" + str(self.name) + ":" + str(self.age)
```
- everything is an object
- class `object` implements basic operations in Python, like binding variables, etc.
- new object class inherits properties of underlying Python `object` class


```python
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self)
        print("Meow!")
    def __str__(self):
        return "cat:" + str(self) + ":" + str(self.age)
```
- add new functionality with `speak()`
    - instance of type `Cat` can be called with new methods
    - instance of type `Animal` throws error if called with new methods
- `__init__` is not missing, uses the `Animal` version
- inheritance, addition of new functionality, and overriding attributes/behaviors all used in this example
```python
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self)
        print("Meow!")
    def __str__(self):
        return "cat:" + str(self) + ":" + str(self.age)

class Rabbit(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Meep!")
    def __str__(self):
        return "rabbit:" + str(self.name) + ":" + str(self.age)
```

---
### Which Method to Use?
---

- subclass can have **methods with the same name** as superclass
- subclass can have **methods with the same name** as other subclasses
- for an instance of a class, look for a method name in **current class definition**
    - if not found, look for method name **up the hierarchy** (in parent, then grandparent, and so on)
    - use method up the hierarchy that you found with that method name

```python
class Person(Animal):                       # parent class is Animal
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        Animal.__init__(self, age)          # call Animal constructor
        Animal.set_name(self, name)         # call Animal's method
        self.friends = []
    def get_friends(self):
        return self.friends
    def add_friend(self, fname):
        if fname not in self.friends:
            self.friends.append(fname)
    def speak(self):
        print("hello")
    def age_diff(self, other):                                                  # new method to give age diff in a user-friendly way
        # alternate way: diff = self.age - other.age
        diff = self.get_age() - other.get_age()
        if self.age > other.age:
            print(self.name, "is", diff, "years older than", other.name)
        else:
            print(self.name, "is", -diff, "years younger than", other.name)
    def __str__(self):                                                          # override Animal's __str__ method
        return "person:" + str(self.name) + ":" + str(self.age)
```

```python
import random

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, major=None):
        Person.__init__(self, name, age)
        self.major = major
    def change_major(self, major):
        self.major = major
    def speak(self):
        r = random.random()                 # method gives back float in the range of 0 to 1
        if r < 0.25:
            print("i have homework")
        elif 0.25 <= r < 0.5:
            print("i need sleep")
        elif 0.5 <= r < 0.75:
            print("i should eat")
        else:
            print("i am watching tv")
    def __str__(self):
        return "student:" + str(self.name) + ":" + str(self.age) + ":" + str(self.major)
```

## 5.7 Class Variables

---
### Instance Variables Vs. Class Variables
---

Instance Variables  
- we have seen **instance variables** so far in code
- specific to an instance
- created for **each instance**, belongs to an instance
- used the generic variable name self within the class definition
    - `self.variable_name`

Class Variables  
- introduce **class variables** that belong to the class
- defined inside the class, but outside any class methods, outside `__init__`
- **shared** among all objects/instances of that class


---
### Class Variables And The Rabbit Class
---

- **subclasses inherit** all data attributes and methods of the parent class
```python
class Rabbit(Animal):
    tag = 1
    def __init__(self, age, parent1=None, parent2=None):
        Animal.__inti__(self, age)
        self.parent1 = parent1
        self.parent2 = parent2
        self.rid = Rabbit.tag
        Rabbit.tag += 1                 # incrementing class variable changes it for all instances that may reference it
```
- `tag` used to give **unique ID** to each new rabbit instance

---
### `Rabbit` Getter Methods
---

```python
class Rabbit(Animal):
    tag = 1
    def __init__(self, age, parent1=None, parent2=None):
        Animal.__init__(self, age)
        self.parent1 = parent1
        self.parent2 = parent2
        self.rid = Rabbit.tag
        Rabbit.tag += 1
    def get_rid(self):
        return str(self.rid).zfill(3)       # zfill method on string to pad beginning with zeros
    def get_parent1(self):
        return self.parent1
    def get_parent2(self):
        return self.parent2
```

---
### Working With Your Own Types
---

```python
def __add__(self, other):
    # returning object of same type as this class
    return Rabbit(0, self, other)
```
- define **+ operator** between two `Rabbit` instances
    - define what something like this does:
        - `r4 = r1 + r2`
        - where `r1` and `r2` are `Rabbit` instances
        - `r4` has `self` as one parent and `other` as the other parent
        - in `__init__`, should change to check that **`parent1` and `parent2` are of type `Rabbit`**

---
### Special Method To Compare Two `Rabbit`s
---

- decide that two rabbits are equal if they have the **same two parents**
```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    parents_same = self.parent1.rid == other.parent1.rid and self.parent2.rid == other.parent2.rid
    parents_opposite = self.parent2.rid == other.parent1.rid and self.parent1.rid == other.parent2.rid
    return parents_same or parents_opposite
```

---
### Summary Of Classes And OOP
---

- **bundle together objects** that share:
    - common attributes
    - procedures that operate on those attributes
- use **abstraction** to make a distinction between how to implement an object vs how to use that object
- build **layers of object abstractions** that inherit behaviors from other classes of objects
- create **our own classes of objects** on top of Python's basic classes
