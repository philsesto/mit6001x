## 5.8 Building a Class

---
### Using Inheritance
---

- explore in some detail an example of building an application that organizes info about people
- start with a `Person` object
    - Person: name, birthday
        - get last name
        - sort by last name
        - get age

---
### Building the Class
---

```python
import datetime

class Person(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        """create person called name"""
        self.name = name
        self.birthday = None
        self.lastName = name.split(' ')[-1]         # split into list of strings, extract last el

    def __lt__(self, other):
        """return True if self's name is lexicographically less than other's name, and False otherwise"""
        if self.lastName == other.lastName:
            return self.name < other.self.name
        return self.lastName < other.lastName

    def getLastName(self):
        """return self's last name"""
        return self.lastName

    def __str__(self):
        """return self's name"""
        return self.name

    def setBirthday(self, month, day, year):
        """sets self's birthday to birthDate"""
        self.birthday = datetime.date(year, month, day)

    def getAge(self):
        """returns self's current age in days"""
        if self.birthday == None:
            raise ValueError
        return (datetime.date.today() - self.birthday).days
```

## 5.9 Visualizing the Hierarchy

---
### Using Inheritance
---

- explore in some detail an example of building an application that orgranizes information about people
    - Person: name, birthday
        - get last name
        - sort by last name
        - get age
    - MITPerson: person, ID number
        - assign ID numbers in sequence
        - get ID numbers
        - sort by ID number

---
### Building Inheritance
---

```python
class MITPerson(Person):
    nextIdNum = 0   # next ID number to assign

    def __init__(self, name):
        Person.__init__(self, name)     # initialize Person attributes
        self.idNum = MITPerson.nextIdNum    # MITPerson attribute: unique ID
        MITPerson.nextIdNum += 1

    def getIdNum(self):
        return self.idNum

    # sorting MIT people uses their ID number, not name!
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.idNum < other.idNum

    def speak(self, utterance):
        return (self.getLastName() + ' says: ' + utterance)
```

---
### How To Compare?
---

- `MITPerson` has its own `__lt__` method
- methods "shadows" the `Person` method, meaning that if we compare an `MITPerson` object, since its environment inherits from the `MITPerson` class environment, Python will see this version of `__lt__`, not the `Person` version
- thus, `p1 < p2` will be converted into `p1.__lt__(p2)` which applies the method associated with the type of `p1`, or the `MITPerson` version

---
### Who Inherits?
---

- why does `p4 < p1` work, but `p1 < p4` doesn't?
    - `p4 < p1` is equivalent to `p4.__lt__(p1)`, which means we use the `__lt__` method associated with the type of `p4`, namely a `Person` (the one that compares based on name)
    `p1 < p4` is equivalent to `p1.__lt__(p4)`, which means we use the `__lt__` method associated with the type of `p1`, namely an `MITPerson`; since `p4` is a `Person`, it does not have an `idNum`

## 5.10 Adding Another Class

---
### Using Inheritance
---

- explore in some detail an example of building an application that orgranizes information about people
    - Person: name, birthday
        - get last name
        - sort by last name
        - get age
    - MITPerson: person, ID number
        - assign ID numbers in sequence
        - get ID numbers
        - sort by ID number
    - Students: several types, all MITPerson
        - undergraduate student: has class year
        - graduate student

---
### More Classes In Hierarchy
---

```python
class UG(MITPerson):
    def __init__(self, name, classYear):
        MITPerson.__init__(self, name)
        self.year = classYear

    def getClass(self):
        return self.year
    
    def speak(self, utterance):
        return MITPerson.speak(self, 'Dude, ' + utterance)

class Grad(MITPerson):
    pass

def isStudent(obj):
    return isinstance(obj,UG) or isinstance(obj,Grad)
```
- in defining `UG` objects' `__init__` method, use the inherited `MITPerson` method to create an instance, which, in turn, will use the `Person` method
- use the inherited `MITPerson.speak` method to speak, but with additional words
- `isStudent` method: test for superclass checks for instances of subclasses

---
### Substitution Principle
---

- so, the class hierarchy in this example:
    - `Person` is the overall **superclass**
    - `MITPerson` inherits from `Person`
    - `UG` and `Grad` each inherit `MITPerson` and its superclass' attributes
    - `UG` features an **overridden** method for `speak` and a unique attribute **of its own**, `classYear`

---
### Adding Another Class
---

```python
class Student(MITPerson):
    pass

class UG(Student):
    def __init__(self, name, classYear):
        MITPerson.__init__(self, name)
        self.year = classYear

    def getClass(self):
        return self.year
    
    def speak(self, utterance):
        return MITPerson.speak(self, 'Dude, ' + utterance)

class Grad(Student):
    pass

class TransferStudent(Student):
    pass

def isStudent(obj):
    return isinstance(obj,Student)
```
- add another superclass that covers all `Students` instead of continually adding more and more clauses to `isStudent` method
    - pretty elegant solution in that superclass handles check suggested by method's name, using that name again in superclass to improve human-readability
    - allows us to fit `TranferStudent` in the mix quite nicely
- we've created a class that captures common behaviors of subclasses; concentrate  methods in one place, think about subclasses as a coherent whole

- **Substitution Principle**
    - important behaviors of a superclass should be supported by all of the subclasses
- be careful when overriding methods in a subclass!

---

## 5.11 Using Inherited Methods

- add a `Professor` class of objects
    - also kind of `MITPerson`
    - has different behaviors from a `Student`
- use as an example to see how one can leverage methods from other classes in the hierarchy

---
### A New Class Of Object
---

```python
class Professor(MITPerson):
    def __init__(self, name, department):
        MITPerson.__init__(self, name)
        self.department = department
    
    def speak(self, utterance):
        new = 'In course ' + self.department + ' we say '
        return MITPerson.speak(self, new + utterance)

    def lecture(self, topic):
        return self.speak('it is obvious that ' + topic)
```
- `speak` here will shadow `MITPerson.speak` method
- then in the `lecture` method, notice the call to `self.speak` instead now

---
### Modularity Helps
---

- by isolating methods in classes, makes it easier to change behaviors
    - can change base behavior of `MITPerson` class, which will be inherited by all other subclasses of `MITPerson`
    - or can change behavior of a lower class in the hierarchy
- change `MITPerson`'s `speak` method to:
```python
def speak(self, utterance):
    return (self.name + ' says: ' + utterance)
```
- change `UG`'s `speak` method to:
```python
def speak(self, utterance):
    return MITPerson.speak(self, 'Yo bro, ' + utterance)
```

---

## 5.12 Gradebook Example

- create a class that includes instances of other classes within it
- concept:
    - build a data structure that can hold grades for students
    - gather together data and procedures for dealing with them in a single structure, so that users can manipulate without having to know internal details

```python
class Grades(obj):
    """A mapping from students to a list of grades"""
    def __init__(self):
        """Create empty gradebook"""
        self.students = []
        self.grades = {}
        self.isSorted = True
    
    def addStudent(self, student):
        """Assumes: student is of type Student
            Add student to the gradebook"""
        if student in self.students:
            raise ValueError('Duplicate student')
        self.students.append(student)
        self.grades[student.getIdNum()] = []
        self.isSorted = False

    def addGrades(self, student, grades):
        """Assumes: grade is a float
        Add grade to the list of grades for student"""
        try:
            self.grades[student.getIdNum()].append(grades)
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError('Student not in grade book')

    def getGrades(self, student):
        """Return a list of grades for student"""
        try:    # to return copy of student's grades
            return self.grades[student.getIdNum()][:]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError('Student not in grade book')

    def allStudents(self):
        """Returns a list of the students in the grade book"""
        if not self.isSorted:
            self.students.sort()
            self.isSorted = True
        return self.students[:]
        # return copy of list of students
```
- index into dict using `getIdNum` method to access `student`'s `idNum`, which returns a list of grades
    - append to that list, mutating the existing list in `addGrades`

---
### Using Gradebook Without Knowing Internal Details
---

```python
def gradeReport(course):
    """Assumes: course is of type grades"""
    report = []
    for s in course.allStudent();
        tot = 0.0
        numGrades = 0
        for g in course.getGrades(s):
            tot += g
            numGrades += 1
        try:
            average = tot/numGrades
            report.append(str(s) + '\'s mean grade is ' + str(average))
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            report.append(str(s) + ' has no grades')
    return '\n'.join(report)
    # carriage return between each student in report
```

---
### Using Example
---

- could list all student using:
```python
for s in six00.students:
    print(s)
```
- but this violates the **data hiding aspect** of an object, and exposes internal representation
    - if we were to change how we represent a grade book, we should only need to change the methods within that object, not external procedures that use it
- for this, we would write that code as so:
```python
for s in six00.allStudents()
    print(s)
```

---

## 5.13 Generators

- any procedure or method with `yield` statement is called a **generator**
```python
def genTest():
    yield 1
    yield 2
```
- generators have a **`next()` method** which starts/resumes execution of the procedure
- inside of generator:
    - `yield` suspends execution and returns a value
    - returning from a generator raises a `StopIteration` exception

---
### Using A Generator
---

```python
>>> foo = genTest()
>>> foo.__next__()
1

>>> foo.__next__()
2

>>> foo.__next__()  # Results in a StopIteration exception
```
- execution will proceed in body of `foo` until reaches first yield statement, then returns value associated with that statement
- then in second call, execution resumes in body of `foo` at point where we last stopped, until reaches next yield statement, then returns value associated with that statement

- can use a generator inside a looping structure, as it will continue until it gets to a `StopIteration` exception:
```python
>>> for n in genTest():
        print(n)

1
2
>>>
```

---
### Fancier Example
---

```python
def genFib():
    fibn_1 = 1  # fib(n-1)
    fibn_2 = 0  # fib(n-2)
    while True:
        # fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
        next = fib_n1 + fibn_2
        yield next
        fibn_2 = fibn_1
        fibn_1 = next
```
- evaluating `fib = genFib()` creates a generator object
- calling `fib.__next__()` will return the first Fibonacci number, and subsequent calls will generate each number in sequence
- evaluating:
```python
for n in genFib():
    print(n)
```
- will produce all of the Fibonacci numbers (an infinite sequence)

- you can maybe see that a great power of a generator is the ability to separate where I stop in the operation from the overall operation I'm trying to encode
    - why is this valuable?

---
### Why Generators?
---

- generator separates the concept of computing a very long sequence of objects, from the actual process of computing them explicity
- allows one to generate each new object as needed as part of another computation (rather than computing a very long sequence, only to throw most of it away while you do something on an element, then repeating the process)
    - have already seen this idea in `range`
        - range return something that gives me the first value and, essentially, a promise to give me the rest when I ask for it

- this is an example of better efficiency through **laziness**: only doing an operation or computation when needed

---
### Fix To Grades Class
---

```python
def allStudents(self):
    if not self.isSorted:
        self.student.sort()
        self.isSorted = True
    return self.students[:]
```
- returns a list of all students
```python
def allStudents(self):
    if not self.isSorted:
        self.students.sort()
        self.isSorted = True
    for s in self.students:
        yield s
```
- runs a loop that yields each student rather than creating a whole list in memory
