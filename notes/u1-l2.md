## 1.7 Bindings

---
### Variables (Revisited)
---

- **name** on the left side
    - descriptive
    - meaningful
    - helps you re-read code
    - *cannot* be **keywords**
- **value** computed on the right side
    - could be any legal expression that returns a value
    - information is stored
    - can be updated with reassignment

---
### Binding Example (Swap)
---

The following is **incorrect** swapping of two variables:  
```python
x = 1
y = 2
y = x
x = y
```
Both variables end up with the value `2`.

*This* would be the correct swap (utilizing a third variable temporarily):
```python
x = 1
y = 2
temp = y
y = x
x = temp
```
Using this `temp` variable, `x` ends up with the `y`'s initial value, `2`, and `y` is `1`.  The variables were successfully swapped.

## 1.8 Strings

**Strings** are letters, special characters, spaces, digits.  They are enclosed in **quotation marks** or **single quotes**.  
`hi = "hello there"`  
`greetings = 'hello'`

Strings can be **concatenated**.  
`name = 'Eric'`
`greeting = hi + ' ' + name`  

---
### Operations On Strings
---

> |  |  |
> | --- | --- |
> | **concatenation** | `'ab' + 'cd'` |
> | **successive concatenation** | `3* 'eric'` |
> | the **length** | `len('eric')` |
> | **indexing** | `'eric'[1]` |
> | **slicing** | `'eric'[1:3]` |

Concatenation
- when we talk about using the addition operator in this way, we say it's *overloaded* as the type of the argument object tells the operation how to proceed  

Strings are **non-scalar objects**; I can get out pieces:

Indexing
- begins with index 0
- attempting to index beyond length -1 is an error

Slicing
- extracts sequence starting at first index and ending before second index
- if no value before `:`, start at 0
- if no value after `:`, end at length
- if just `:`, make a copy of entire sequence

## 1.9 Input/Output

---
### Input/Output: `print()`
---

- used to **output** stuff to the console
- `print` is **keyword**

---
### Input/Output: `input("")`
---

- prints whatever is within the quotes
- user types in something and hits enter
- returns entered sequence
- can bind that value to a variable so can reference
```python
text = input("Type something...")
print(5*text)
```
- input **returns a string** so must cast if working with numbers
```python
num = int(input("Type a number..."))
print(5*num)
```

---

## 1.10 IDEs

**text-editor** used to manipulate files alone or it can be part of an **integrated development environment**   (IDE)

Anaconda is an example of an IDE (which we'll use for the course)  
IDLE is another version  

- IDE can include, but not limited to:
    - text editor
    - shell
    - integrated debuggers

## 1.11 Control Flow

---
### Using Control in Loops
---

- simple branching programs just make choices, but path through code is still linear
- sometimes want to reuse parts of the code indeterminate number of times

---
### Control Flow: `while` Loops
---

```python
while <condition>:
    <expression>
    <expression>
    ...
```

- `<condition>` evaluates to a Boolean
- if `<condition>` is `True`, do all the steps inside the while code block
- check `<condition>` again
- repeat until `<condition>` is `False`

---
### Control Flow: `while` And `for` Loops
---

```python
n = 0
while n < 5:
    print(n)
    n += 1
```

```python
for n in range(5):    # range(5) gives us the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in turn
    print(n)
```

---
### Control Flow: `for` Loops
---

```python
for <variable> in range(<some_num>):
    <expression>
    <expression>
    ...
```

- each time through the loop, `<variable>` takes a value
- first time, `<variable>` starts at the smallest value
- next time, `<variable>` gets the previous value plus one
- etc

---
### `range(start, stop, step)`
---

- default values are for `start = 0` and `step = 1`
- loop until value is `stop-1`

```python
mysum = 0
for i in range(7, 10, 2):
    mysum += 1
print(mysum)
```

---
### `break` Statement
---

- immediately exits whatever loop it is in
- skips remaining expressions in code block
- exits only innermost loop

```python
while <condition_1>:
    while <condition_2>:
        <expression_a>
        break
        <expression_b>
    <expression_c>
```

---
### `for` Vs. `while` Loops
---

> `for loops`  
> - know number of iterations
> - can end early via `break`
> - uses a **counter**
> - can rewrite a `for` loop using a `while` loop

> `while loops`  
> - unbounded number of iterations
> - can end early via `break`
> - can use a **counter**, but must initialize before loop and increment it inside the loop
> - may no be able to rewrite a `while` loop using a `for` loop

---

## 1.12 Iteration

The concept of iteration let's us extend simple branching programs to be able to write programs of arbitrary complexity.  Executes an arbitrary number of times.  
- start with a test
- if evals to `True`, then execute the loop body once, and go back to reeval the test
- repeat until test evals to `False`, after which code following the iteration statement is executed

---
### Iterative Code 
---

- Branching structures (conditionals) allow us to jump to different pieces of code based on a test
    - programs in **constant time**
- Looping structures (for and while, for example) let us repeat pieces of code until a condition is satisfied
    - programs now take 

---

## 1.13 Guess And Check

Iterative algorithms allow us to do more complex things than just arithmetic.  

We can repeat a sequence of steps multiple times based on some decision; leads to new classes of algorithms
- one useful example is "guess and check"

---
### Guess And Check 
---

If we have a good way to systematically generate guesses, we can use declarative knowledge better.  
- loops to do this

---
### Loop Characteristics
---

- Need a loop variable
    - initialized outside the loop
    - changes within loop
    - test for termination depends on variable
- Useful to think about a **decrementing function**
    - maps set of program variables into an integer
    - when loop is entered, value is non-negative
    - when value is `<= 0`, loop terminates
    - value is decreased every time through loop

---
### What If We Miss A Condition?
---

- suppose we don;t initialize the variable?
    - likely get a `NameError` or worse; use an unexpected value to initiate the computation
- suppose we don't change the variable inside the loop?
    - will end up in an infinite loop, never reaching the terminating condition

---
### Cleaner Guess And Check
---

```python
cube = 8
for guess in range(cube+1):
    if guess**3 == cube:
        print("Cube root of ", cube, " is ", guess)
```

---
### Exhaustive Enumeration
---

- guess and check methods can work on problems with a finite number of possibilities
- exhaustive enumeration is a good way to generate guesses in an organized manner
