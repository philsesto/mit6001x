# Unit 3: Structured Types

# Lecture 5: Tuples And Lists

## 3.1 Tuples

- *ordered* sequence of elements, can include any different type of element within; i.e., can mix element types
    - don't mean to say that the elements in the sequence are ordered, but rather the sequence itself as an order so that I can get to different parts of the sequence by simply indexing , much like with strings, 
- **immutable**, cannot change
- represented with parentheses
`te = ()`
`t = (2, 'one', 3)`
`t[0]` -> evals to `2`
`(2, 'one', 3) + (5, 6)` -> evals to `(2, 'one', 3, 5, 6)`
`t[1:2]` -> evals to `('one',)` (the extra comma designates a single-item tuple)
`t[1:3]` -> evals to `('one', 3)`
`t[1] = 4` -> throws error, can't modify object

- tuples are conveniently used to swap variables
    - `(x, y) = (y, x)` switches the `x` and `y` variables without the need for a `temp` variable

- tuples used to **return more than one value** from a function:
```python
def quotient_and_remainder(x, y):
    q = x//y
    r = x%y
    return (q, r)
(quot, rem) = quotient_and_remainder(4,5)
```

- tuples are **iterable**, can treat them as if they 're just a single construct, same as we would with range function or a string:
```python
def get_data(aTuple):
    """
    Input: a tuple containing tuples containing an int and a string

    Outputs a tuple containing min_nums, max_nums, and the count of unique_words
    """
    nums = ()
    words = ()
    for t in aTuple:
        nums = nums + (t[0],)
        if t[1] not in words:
            words = words + (t[1],)
    min_nums = min(nums)
    max_nums = max(nums)
    unique_words = len(words)
    return (min_nums, max_nums, unique_words)
```

## 3.2 Lists

- **ordered sequence** of information, accessible by index
- a list is denoted by **square brackets**, `[]`
- a list contains **elements** 
    - usually a homogenous (i.e., all integers)
    - can contain mixed element types (not as commonly)
- list items can be changed, so a list is **mutable**

Mutability (like strings vs tuples), can be both really useful, and it can provide some challenges because it opens opportunities to make mistakes that we don't expect.  

---
### Indices And Ordering
---

- an element of a list is at a position (aka **index**) in the list (indices starting at zero)
- an element of a list can be a **variable** or **expression** must evaluate to an `int`

---
### Changing Elements
---

- lists are **mutable**
- assigning to an element at an index changes the value
    - a new list is not created, but rather *that object* has been changed

---
### Iterating Over A List
---

- compute the **sum of elements** of a list
- commmon pattern
```python
total = 0
for i in range(len(L)):
    total += L[i]
print(total)
```
- notice list elements are indexed `0` to `len(L)-1`
    - range(n) goes from `0` to `n-1`
```python
total = 0
for i in L:
    total += i
print(i)
```

---

## 3.3 List Operations

---
### Add
---

- **add** elements to end of a list with `L.append(elt)`
- **mutates** the list
`L = [1, 2, 3]`
`L.append(5)` -> list evals to [2, 1, 3, 5] now

- if you're asking yourself, "what's the dot?":
    - lists are Python objects, everything in Python is an object
    - objects have data
    - objects have methods and functions
    - access this information by `object_name.do_something()`
        - more on this topic later

- to combine lists together, use **concatenation**, `+` operator
- **mutate** list with `L.extend(some_list)`

---
### Remove
---

- delete an element at a **specific index** with `del(L[index])`
- remove element at **end of list** with `L.pop()`, returns the removed element
- remove a **specific element** with `L.remove(element)`
    - looks for element and removes it
    - if element occurs multiple times, removes first occurrence
    - if element not in list, throws an error

---
### Conversions (Lists To Strings And Vice-Versa)
---

- convert string to a list with `list(s)`, returns a list with every character from `s` an element in `L`
- can use `s.split()`, to split a string on a character parameter, splits on spaces without a parameter
- use `''.join(L)` to turn a **list of characters into a string**; can give a character (in quotes) to add char between every element

---
### Other List Operations
---

- `sort()` and `sorted()`
    - `sorted()` returns a new list
    - `sort()` mutates the list on which it's called
- `reverse()`

---
### Bringing Together Loops, Functions, `range`, And Lists
---

- `range` is a special procedure
    - returns something that **behaves like a tuple**
    - doesn't generate the elements at once, rather it generates ther first element, and provides an iteration method by which subsequent elements can be generated (see generators)
`range(5)` -> equivalent to tuple `(0,1,2,3,4)`
`range(2, 6)` -> equivalent to tuple `(2,3,4,5)`
`range(5, 2, -1)` -> equivalent to tuple `(5,4,3)`
- when use `range` in a `for` loop, what the loop variable iterates over behaves like a list:
```python
for var in range(5):
    <expressions>
```
- behind the scenes, gets converted to something that will behave like:
```python
for var in (0,1,2,3,4):
    <expressions>
```

## 3.4 Mutation, Aliasing, Cloning

Being able to change elements within a list is a nice tool, but it causes some really interesting potential for problems
- the following will explain those problems and how they can arise and how you can guard against them

---
### Lists in Memory
---

- lists are **mutable**
- behave differently than immutable types
- is an object in memory
- variable name points to object
- any variable pointing to that object is affected
- key phrase to keep in mind when working with lists is **side effects**

---
### An Analogy
---

- attributes of a person
    - wrestler, famous
-  he is known by many names
- all nicknames point to the **same person**
    - add new attribute to **one nickname**
    - **all the nicknames** refer to old attributes AND all new ones

---
### Aliases
---

- `hot` is an alias for `warm`--changing one changes the other
- `append()` has a side effect
```python
a = 1
b = a
print(a)
print(b)
warm = ['red', 'yellow', 'orange']
hot = warm
hot.append('pink')
print(hot)
print(warm)
```

---
### `print` Is Not `==`
---

-  if two lists print the same thing, does not mean they are the same structure
- can test by mutating one, and checking
- have to be careful when we think about how to use these elements of structures that can mutate
```python
cool = ['blue', 'green', 'grey']
chill = ['blue', 'green', 'grey']
print(cool)
print(chill)
chill[2] = 'blue'
print(cool)
print(chill)
```

---
### Cloning A List
---

- create a new list and **copy everything** using `chill = cool[:]`
```python
cool = ['blue', 'green', 'grey']
chill = cool[:]

chill.append('black')
print(chill)
print(cool)
```

---
### Sorting Lists
---

- calling `sort()` **mutates the list**, returns nothing
- calling `sorted()`, **does not mutate** list, must assign result to a variable
```python
warm = ['red', 'yellow', 'orange']
sortedWarm = warm.sort()
print(warm)
print(sortedWarm)

cool = ['grey', 'green', 'blue']
sortedCool = sorted(cool)
print(cool)
print(sortedCool)
```

---
### Lists Of Lists Of Lists Of ...
---

- can have nested lists
- side effects still possible after mutation
```python
warm = ['yellow', 'orange']
hot = ['red']
brightColors = [warm]
```

---
### Mutation And Iteration 
---

- **avoid** mutating a list as you're iterating over it
    - Python uses an internal counter to keep track of the current index while looping (as with all *iterables*)
    - mutating can change the list length, but Python doesn't update the counter  (see example below, where counter doesn't update and loop never sees element 2)
- the intention of this code is to remove duplicates in a list...
- wrong way:
```python
def remove_dups(L1, L2)
    for e in L1:
        if e in L2:
            L1.remove(e)
```
- correct method:
```python
def remove_dups(L1, L2):
    L1_copy = L1[:]
    for e in L1_copy:
        if e in L2:
            L1.remove(e)
```

---

## 3.5 Functions As Objects

- functions are **first-class** objects
    - have types
    - can be elements of data structures like lists
    - can appear in expressions
        - as part of an assignment statement
        - as an argument to a function
- particularly useful to use functions as arguments when coupled with lists
    - aka **higher-order programming** (using functions inside of lists to do things on lists)
    
- ex. (apply a list of numbers to a function):
```python
def applyToEach(L, f):
    """
    assumes L is a list , f a function; mutates L by replacing each element, e, of L by f(e)
    """
    for i in range(len(L)):
        L[i] = f(L[i])
```
- could do this the other direction as well (apply a list of functions to a number):
```python
def applyFuns(L, x):
    for f in L:
        print(f(x))
```

---
### A Generalization Of Higher-Order Procedures
---

- Python provides a general purpose HOP called `map`
- simple form -- a unary function and a collection of suitabke arguments
    - `map(abs, [1, -2, 3, -4])`
- produces an iterable that we can then "walk" down
```python
for elt in map(abs, [1, -2, 3, -4]):
    print(elt)
```
- map gives me back a structure that's going to act like a list, but which I'll have to walk down/iterate over to get back out
    - i.e. really nice way of abstracting the idea of applying something to a collection
- general form -- an n-ary function (expects *n* arguments) and n collections of arguments
```python
L1 = [1, 28, 36]
L2 = [2, 57, 9]
for elt in map(min, L1, L2):
    print(elt)
    # prints [1, 28, 9]
```
- in summary, `map()` is a very nice generalization about thinking about functions as if they were objects that can be applied in appropriate places
